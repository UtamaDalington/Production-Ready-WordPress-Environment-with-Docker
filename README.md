Establishing a Production-Ready WordPress Environment with Container Orchestration (Docker) Architecture

Project Overview
----------------

A project focused on leveraging containerization best practices to create a reproducible and isolated WordPress stack. The solution uses Docker volumes to ensure data persistence and implements internal networking for secure service communication between the application and database containers, highly portable and scalable environment.

1.  [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/): A cloud service that provides scalable virtual computing resources (instances), allowing users to rent and deploy virtual servers to host applications and workloads.
2.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A platform designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containers. A container is a standardized, isolated package of software that holds everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.\
    The key idea is that a container runs the same way, regardless of where it is deployed (on a developer's laptop, a test server, or a production cloud VM).
3.  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/): Docker Hub is the world's largest cloud-based container registry provided by Docker for storing, managing, and sharing Docker container images.\
    It acts as a central hub for the Docker community and commercial users, enabling developers to easily find, download, and distribute container images for their applications.

### Why is Docker Essential?

Docker solves the classic developer problem: *"It works on my machine!"*

-   Portability and Consistency: It ensures the application's environment is consistent across all stages (Development, Testing, Production).
-   Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, meaning an issue in one application won't affect others running on the same host machine.
-   Efficiency: Containers are lightweight, sharing the host machine's operating system kernel. This makes them much faster to start and requires far less overhead than traditional Virtual Machines (VMs).
-   Speed of Deployment (CI/CD): Docker integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to build a single artifact (the container image) that can be reliably deployed thousands of times.

Step 1: (Launch an EC2 instance)
--------------------------------

-   Create an Ubuntu 24.04 VM instance and call it "Docker"
-   Instance type: t3.micro (2 vCPU and 1 GiB Memory)
-   Security Group (Open port): 8080 and 22 to 0.0.0.0/0 or Your-IP
-   Key pair: Select or create a new keypair
-   User data (Copy the following user data): <https://github.com/UtamaDalington/Maven-SonarQube-Nexus-Jenkins-installations/blob/main/install-docker.sh>
-   Launch Instance

Step 2: (Configure the EC2 instance)
------------------------------------

Follow the commands in the script to install Apache HTTP Server, WordPress, and MySQL Database using Docker.

-   User data (Copy the following user data): <https://github.com/UtamaDalington/Maven-SonarQube-Nexus-Jenkins-installations/blob/main/docker-install-wordpress.md>

Step 3: (Congratulations)
-------------------------

Your WordPress Application is now up and running.

-   Access Application with: [http://EC2_Public_IP:8080](http://ec2_public_ip:8080/)
